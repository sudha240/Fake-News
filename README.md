# Fake News Detection

In this project, we aimed to build a news classification model to distinguish between **True** and **Fake** news articles. The primary goal was to design a system that could automatically identify the authenticity of news based on its textual content.

The approach involved:
- Text processing
- Feature extraction
- Application of various machine learning algorithms

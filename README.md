Fake News Detection
In this project, we aimed to build a news classification model to distinguish between True and Fake news articles. 
The primary goal was to design a system that could automatically identify the authenticity of news based on its textual content.
The approach involved text processing, feature extraction, and the application of various machine learning algorithms
